                The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand network communication in seven distinct layers.
				Working with the OSI Model has given me practical experience in resolving network problems, enhancing network efficiency, and guaranteeing appropriate communication between various devices and protocols. By comprehending the role and interconnectedness of each layer, I've been able to apply solutions across a range of network configurations and address problems at many levels, from hardware to application communication.

                Verifying port connectivity is an essential step in network management and troubleshooting, making certain that devices can interact with one another through designated ports. This includes utilizing tools such as Test-NetConnection, ping, and netcat to check open ports, identify firewall problems, and confirm appropriate data transmission. From my experience, I have engaged in extensive port connectivity testing to pinpoint and address communication issues, enhance network performance, and secure systems by verifying that only essential ports are open and reachable. This practical experience has been crucial in ensuring dependable and safe network settings.
